leftDoubleImage,My Best Thing (2011),Frances Stark,"Frances Stark’s My Best Thing began as a series of webcam encounters on Chatroulette. What emerged was a work about sex, but also about art, anxiety, miscommunication, authorship, and the strange intimacy of talking to strangers online. Using free animation software and default “Adam and Eve” avatars, Stark transforms text-chat transcripts into something that’s simultaneously ridiculous and disarmingly honest. The software is generic, but the dialogue is specific, full of insecurity, ego, self-consciousness, and play.The voices are robotic. The avatars are clunky. But the conversations move fast- sometimes into philosophy, sometimes into personal confession, sometimes into nothing at all.

What’s interesting is how Stark doesn’t try to clean any of it up. The awkwardness stays. The humour stays. The misunderstandings, the language gaps, the lag between emotional expression and digital delivery are all part of the work. And yet, despite all that friction, something resembling connection starts to form. These were originally sex-based chats, but they grow into collaborative exchanges about dancehall, Rancière, political unrest, and what it even means to make art in a world saturated with content.

The internet here, isn’t treated as a problem to be solved or a space to escape. It’s taken seriously, even in its messiest forms, as a site of creative and social possibility. What Stark captures isn’t idealism, but potential- how even the most disposable platforms might, under the right conditions, allow something real to emerge.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56eb27558a65e2c2a033b13c/1459442286756-Z6RHLGEPSHUOYWFEXOMR/MyBestThing_FrancesStark_NTP.jpg?format=1000w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/znss6j8p/production/5e81de03efa92a43d3e68d91ebbfd06b93f2e492-1280x720.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&q=55&fit=crop&crop=entropy&auto=format&dpr=2,,"My Best Thing, Frances Stark, Tate Modern, 2011",https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/stark-my-best-thing-t14683,"WebArt, Digital Curation, Digital Surveillanve"
left,Loewe Pixel Hoodie (2023),"Loewe,  Jonathan Anderson","The Loewe pixel hoodie plays with perception in a way that feels quietly sharp. Its jagged edges and blocky shading suggest a digital glitch or low-resolution rendering, something seen on a screen before it's seen on a body. What’s striking is that it doesn’t use digital technology; it simply mimics its language. In doing so, it calls attention to how much of fashion now lives as image, flattened, filtered, and shared.

It’s a garment designed for the gaze of a digitised world, where clothes are more likely to be encountered in lookbooks, livestreams, or posts than in person. The garment plays with this shift, turning the aesthetic of compression into craft. But it also hints at something more: a tension between appearance and substance, between seeing and touching, between the image of fashion and its material reality.

There is also something about the irony of labor here. The hoodie is painstakingly constructed to resemble something made cheaply or automatically. It reflects how digital culture collapses distinctions between the precious and the disposable, the crafted and the virtual.

While Loewe doesn’t offer an intended interpretation of any kind, they intentionally invite viewers to second guess what they are looking at, and by extension,  how you’re using to seeing.

leftDoubleImage,9 Eyes of Google Street View (2008 - Ongoing),Jon Rafman,"9 Eyes of Google Street View is an ongoing project by Jon Rafman, built entirely from images taken by the nine-lens camera systems mounted on Google’s mapping cars. These photographs aren’t composed in the traditional sense; no framing, no decisive moment, yet Rafman treats them like something worth collecting. His role isn’t to capture, but to select, notice and curate.

What makes the project compelling is how it treats a utilitarian tool; Street View as a sprawling archive of accidental documentation. The images weren’t taken for aesthetic purposes, but Rafman’s selections hint at stories: a man mid-fall, a figure lying alone under an overpass, people staring directly into the lens without knowing what it is. There’s an eerie neutrality to the camera, but the moments Rafman surfaces feel charged.

There’s also a tension between what the technology records and what we’re trained to see. The camera captures everything equally, without intention. But our gaze isn’t neutral. We assign meaning, pattern, mood. Rafman uses this to explore how much human attention still matters, even when images are generated by machines.

Rather than making a clear argument about surveillance or data collection, the work lingers in ambiguity. It reflects on what it means to look, to interpret, and to assign value to images that were never meant to be seen twice. In that way, it sits quietly inside the ethics of vision in a world already over-documented.","https://d1v7jayx2s9clc.cloudfront.net/user/pages/9-eyes/Monzenmachi%20Dori,%20Nagoya,%20Aichi%20Prefecture,%20Japan.jpg",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IcnQ7TxFicMVoIT8_LGfIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_camera_world_590/ad9bc6f3ad7f3ab210ef9d354ffb0eed,"Google Street View Capture, 2009","Google Street View Capture, 2004",https://9-eyes.com/,"Algorithmic Photography, Digital Curation, Surveillance"

The project uses the infrastructure of public surveillance, normally impersonal, anonymous, and opaque as a space for something intimate. Magid dressed in bright red to be easily tracked by camera operators, and later submitted formal footage requests using “Subject Access Requests.” These requests took the form of handwritten letters, part legal, part poetic, often addressed directly to the surveillance workers themselves.

The result is a strange interplay between systems of observation and personal expression. The footage itself is uneventful- walking down streets, pausing at corners, but the framework around it creates tension. Magid isn’t resisting the gaze, but offering herself to it, on her own terms. But the system doesn’t change in response. It stays rigid, procedural.

There’s something quietly disarming about watching someone willingly step into a space designed to monitor without consent. By engaging with the bureaucracy, Magid reveals how surveillance systems rely on a kind of emotional distance. 

Rather than taking a clear stance for or against surveillance, Evidence Locker asks what happens when intimacy is inserted into systems that were built to eliminate it.

A salt circle is poured on the ground, broken only by a dashed outer ring. In the centre sits a self-driving car, completely still. Nothing is physically holding it there, but it refuses to move. The car’s sensors interpret the salt as a boundary, something it should not cross, and so it stays put. What Bridle sets up is not a technical failure, but a scenario where the system’s rules prevent it from acting.

The piece works because of its simplicity. A low-tech gesture quietly overrides a complex, intelligent machine. It feels absurd at first, almost like a prank, but the implications run deeper. The car’s paralysis reveals something fragile about systems we are told are advanced or autonomous. When faced with an unfamiliar input, the machine has no capacity for interpretation. It can only follow the instructions it was built on.

Bridle often explores the limits of machine reasoning and the opacity of systems we rely on without fully understanding. This piece doesn’t announce itself as a warning, but it opens space to reflect on how power is coded into technology. It also raises questions about human responsibility.

Written by design collective Moniker, the manifesto lays out a way of working that favours process over product, systems over outcomes, and participation over control. Rather than aiming for polished final pieces, the focus is on setting up conditions and letting them unfold.

At the centre of this approach is the idea that design can function like a living system. You set the parameters, define a set of rules, and then let the result emerge through repetition, interaction, and time. The process is generative, but it resists the idea of automation. There’s something intentionally lo-fi about it. The outcomes are shaped by hands, pens, and small group dynamics, not just code or computational precision.

The manifesto values constraints, not as limitations, but as starting points. It treats algorithms not as tools for efficiency, but as structures for play and experimentation. In that sense, it mirrors the logic behind many generative systems, where complexity comes not from complexity itself, but from simple rules repeated again and again.",https://dukduk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/conditionaldesignmanifesto.png,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRZegIfDKCe8RydrCNmWdqSaZjgJrVF5rYAIA&s,"Conditional Design Manifesto, Moniker, 2008","Conditional Design Manifesto, Moniker, 2008",https://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/,"Generative Drawing, #Rulez, Participation"

The piece takes Holzer’s iconic Truisms; short, loaded statements like “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” and feeds them into an interactive form. Visitors can read the statements, respond to them, or submit their own, creating a loop between fixed language and user-driven input. It’s simple in structure, but what it’s asking is complicated.

The work foregrounds the instability of meaning. Holzer’s texts have always operated like that- short enough to feel true, contradictory enough to make you question why. In this context, they become prompts for reflection, argument, or projection. There’s no right way to interact with them, but you’re not passive either. The piece recognises that meaning is shaped through repetition, reaction, and collective response.

It also feels very much rooted in the early ethos of the web, as a space where authorship could be shared, where systems could be reprogrammed or responded to directly. There’s a democratic impulse running through it, but not an idealistic one.

Each one reads like a poetic prompt or absurd directive: “Imagine letting a goldfish swim across the sky” or “Draw a map to get lost.” Some are playful, others are strangely moving, but all of them invite the reader to participate. Not by completing a task in a strict sense, but by entering into the space the instruction opens up.

The work operates through suggestion rather than prescription. Ono doesn’t tell you what to think, and the instructions often resist any practical execution. But that’s part of their strength. They are scores for the imagination, built from minimal language, where the outcome is not the point. The instruction is both the work and the invitation.

There’s a clear connection here to rule-based systems, but in a very loose, human sense. These aren’t algorithms in the computational way, but they are formulaic. Each one sets a condition and waits for the reader to activate it. That activation might happen internally, or through gesture, or not at all.

What’s especially compelling is how Grapefruit anticipates participatory and conceptual practices that came decades later. It treats the audience as a co-author and language as a generative material. The work is deeply personal but built from shared structures.

Not a theme or a mood board, but a prompt- abstract, open-ended, and deliberately ambiguous. Words like “invisible,” “absence,” or “not making clothes” serve as starting points, not directives. From there, her team of patternmakers interprets the prompt individually, each creating forms that respond to it in their own way. These initial pieces are then brought together, not to select a winner, but to observe what emerges collectively. The process is iterative, with garments evolving through discussion, adjustment, and reworking.

This method treats design as a system of generative constraints. The prompt acts as a seed, the patternmakers as agents within a set of rules, and the final collection as an emergent property of the system. It’s a human algorithm, where the variables are intuition, experience, and interpretation. The outcome is not predetermined, but discovered through the process.

What’s compelling is how this process mirrors broader themes in generative and rule-based art. It embraces uncertainty, values process over product, and sees constraints not as limitations, but as opportunities for exploration. In doing so, Kawakubo redefines what it means to design, shifting the focus from the individual creator to the system of creation itself.",https://assets.vogue.com/photos/55d7a210a29b3c331d148b80/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/COMME-DES-GARCONS-SPRING-1997-RTW-08.jpg,,"Comme des Garcons Spring 1997, Rei Kawakubo",,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-1997-ready-to-wear/comme-des-garcons,"Generative Co-creation, Collective Authorship, Process over Outcome"

The shirts are redistributed anonymously, and participants choose who they’d like to date based solely on scent. If there’s a mutual match, the pair is connected.

The project plays with the language and structure of dating apps but replaces data with biology. It takes something ancient and embodied; smell, and places it at the centre of a system that typically flattens attraction into swipeable profiles and predictive algorithms. The matching process is still rule-based, still systematised, but the criteria are completely outside the logic of metrics and machine learning.

What’s interesting here is how the project resists optimisation. There’s no “better” smell, no algorithm that improves over time.

There is no object to observe, no image to interpret, just the room itself, alternating between illumination and darkness.

The piece challenges traditional expectations of art by removing visual content and focusing on the viewer's experience within the space. The shifting light conditions heighten awareness of the room's architecture, the presence of others, and one's own body. This cyclical pattern creates a rhythm that is both predictable and unsettling, prompting reflection on the passage of time and the nature of perception.

Creed's work aligns with minimalist and conceptual art traditions, emphasizing ideas over material form. By using the existing infrastructure of the gallery; its lights and space, he transforms the environment into the artwork itself. This approach invites viewers to consider the boundaries of art and the role of context in shaping experience.

The setup included infant monkeys who were removed from their mothers and given two surrogates. One was made of cold, bare wire but dispensed milk. The other, covered in soft cloth, offered no nourishment at all. Despite this, the monkeys consistently chose the cloth surrogate, clinging to it for comfort even though it couldn’t feed them. The results showed that when given a choice, they preferred warmth, softness, and the illusion of care over functionality.

Harlow’s work challenges us to consider what humans (or animals) truly want from interactive systems. His monkeys did not gravitate toward the machine that “performed” a task (feeding), but the one that felt alive, offering warmth, perceived protection, and contact. In a world increasingly filled with robotic pets, AI companions, and emotionally expressive interfaces, these early surrogates forecast a critical question: Is affective interaction about intelligence, or about form, vulnerability, and presence?

Ultimately, these studies underscore the tension at the heart of emotional computing: between real connection and the simulation of it, between care and its technological stand-ins.",https://media.sciencephoto.com/g3/52/04/06/g3520406-800px-wm.jpg,,"Harlow's Monkey Experiment, Harry Harlow, Year unknown",,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow,"Speculative Prototypes, Human & Machine, AI Attachment"

Mechanical wiper arms move in slow repetition across a surface of faux fur. The gesture is recognisable: stroking, caressing, maybe even comforting, but it’s also uncanny. There are no sensors, feedback, or response. The machine does not adjust or attend, but just repeats, asking what happens when the movements of intimacy are stripped of agency, warmth, and reciprocity.

The use of motorized touch here becomes deeply ambiguous. On one hand, it mimics comfort, softness, even eroticism; on the other, it evokes discomfort, absurdity, and loss. There’s a haunting quality in the idea of a machine trying (and failing) to replicate emotional labor. The fur caress becomes a metaphor for how gesture can be emptied of meaning under conditions of automation and repetition. These works turn the promise of “smart” interaction on its head: there are no sensors, no inputs, no feedback.

The technology behind it is subtle, one that positions the body as a site of authorship, and clothing as something that emerges through participation, not just consumption.

It invites touch, decision-making, and physical intervention. In that sense, it behaves more like a program than a textile. The user interprets, edits, executes, and what results is never entirely predictable.

A-POC resists the dominant narrative of innovation as sleek, digital, or sensor-driven, but technology is any system or tool that extends human capability. It reframes technology as something slow, open-ended, and embodied.

Framed around the idea of the “meme”, the exhibition treated robots as carriers of cultural information, or replicators of human ideas, gestures, and desires. It was about asking what robots mean, and why we feel so much when we look at them.

One installation, Cyclops, was a towering robot with a flexible spine of spherical joints and an unblinking camera eye. It swayed gently, tracking visitors with its gaze. The effect was both tender and unsettling, a mechanical being that watched without judgment, evoking questions about surveillance, presence, and what it means to be seen.

P-noir, by contrast, was a delicate, music-box-like robot that danced on command. Visitors could manipulate its movements and expressions through an interface, turning it into a kind of emotional puppet. It invited interaction, but also highlighted the asymmetry of control of who was performing for whom.

Then there was Orchisoid, a hybrid of orchid and machine. It measured the bioelectric currents of living plants, translating their subtle responses to environmental changes into robotic movement. Here, the robot wasn’t mimicking life, but rather blurring the line between organism and mechanism.

Together, these works reframed robotics as a cultural practice, not just a technical one. They suggested that robots are shaped as much by our myths and metaphors as by our engineering.

Its stillness contrasts sharply with the dynamic environment, prompting viewers to consider their role as observers and the nature of visibility in public spaces.

The sculpture echoes themes of concealment and revelation, drawing inspiration from Belgian surrealism and artists like René Magritte, who famously stated, ""Everything we see hides another thing."" As individuals circle Blinds, attempting to glimpse what lies behind, they find only their reflections, emphasizing the perpetual interplay between seen and unseen. 

In an era dominated by ""always-on"" technology and constant connectivity, Blinds serves as a counterpoint, a silent, unresponsive presence that challenges the expectation of interaction. It encourages a moment of introspection, urging passersby to reflect on the pervasive nature of surveillance and the value of privacy in contemporary society.","https://images.e-flux-systems.com/640486_ca04754384b0e1c099efb56753305cb4.jpg,1600",,"Blinds, Martin Margiela, 2024",,https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/640486/martin-margiela-blinds/,"Surveillance Critique, Anti-Interaction, Public Privacy"
